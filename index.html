    <p>Epilepsy is a neurological disorder in which a person has repeated seizures due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain.</p>

    <h2>Causes:</h2>
    <p>Genetic factors, brain injury, infections, birth-related problems, or sometimes unknown causes.</p>

    <h2>Common Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Seizures (fits), brief loss of awareness, unusual movements, staring spells, or confusion after an episode.</p>
